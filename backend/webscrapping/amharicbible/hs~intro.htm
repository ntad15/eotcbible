<p class=center><b>AMHARIC BIBLE</b></p>
<p class=bodytext>&quot;Interlitt&quot;, the publishing arm of Lapsley/Brooks Foundation, is proud and pleased to present the Bible in Amharic, the language of Ethiopia. </p>
<p class=bodytext>Christianity entered Ethiopia in the 4th century, and the Bible was translated into Geez (Ethiopic) thereafter. This Bible was revised in the 14th Century. The first complete Amharic Bible was produced in 1840, and went thru several revisions thereafter. The version of the Bible presented here was the fulfillment of the expressed desire of Haile Selassie, and was first published in 1962. </p>
<p class=bodytext>In 1992-93, with the blessing and support of the Ethiopian Bible Society and Ato Kebede Mamo, the Director, the Bible was computerized by Hiruye Stige and his wife Genet.  It is our pleasure to make God's Word, in this electronic form, available to this part of His family.</p>
<p class=bodytext>Many thanks to Brad Lapsley and Dirk R&ouml;ckmann for their work in making this translation available. GF Zemen Unicode is the font that is used. If you are unable to see the text in Amharic font, please download the GF Zemen font.</p>
